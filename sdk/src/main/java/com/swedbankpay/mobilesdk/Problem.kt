/**
 * Base class for any problems encountered in the payment.
 *
 * Problems always result from communication with the backend;
 * lower-level network errors are not represented by Problems,
 * but rather by IOExceptions as is usual.
 *
 * Swedbank interfaces, as well as the example merchant backend,
 * report problems using the Problem Details for HTTP APIs
 * protocol (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807), specifically the
 * json representation. Your custom merchant backend is enouraged to
 * do so as well. These classes provide a convenient java representation
 * of the problems so your client code does not need to deal with the raw
 * json. Any custom problem cases you add to your merchant backend will
 * be reported as "Unknown" problems, and you will have to implement
 * parsing for those in your client, of course.
 *
 * All problems are either [Client] or [Server] problems. A Client
 * problem is one where there was something wrong with the request
 * the client app sent to the service. A Client problem always implies an
 * HTTP response status in the Client Error range, 400-499.
 *
 * A Server problem in one where the service understood the request, but
 * could not fulfill it. If the backend responds in an unexpected
 * manner, the situation will be interpreted as a Server error, unless
 * the response status is in 400-499, in which case it is still considered a
 * Client error.
 *
 * This separation to Client and Server errors provides a crude but often
 * effective way of distinguishing between temporary service unavailability
 * and permanent configuration errors. Indeed, the PaymentFragment will internally
 * consider any Client errors to be fatal, but most Server errors to be retryable.
 *
 * Client and Server errors are further divided to specific types. See individual
 * class documentation for details.
 *
 * There are also several interfaces defined for related problem types.
 * They are:
 *
 *  - [ProperProblem]: problems actually parsed from a application/problem+json object
 *  - [SwedbankPayProblem]: problems originating from Swedbank Pay backends
 *  - [UnknownProblem]: problems of an unknown [type][https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807#section-3.1]
 *  - [UnexpectedContentProblem]: (pseudo-)problems where the response was not application/problem+json
